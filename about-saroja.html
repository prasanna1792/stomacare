		  <h5 class="text-danger">Foreword from Ms.C.A.Saroja :</h5>
		  <p>
		  	Ostomy surgeries were performed by surgeons in south India in early 1950s. There were no proper appliance, Medical history says that patients (Ostomates) were using bulky pads and bandages, tins and cups to collect the effluent. This made them to be isolated from their own family members, because of effluent leakage and odour. They were cut off from the society.
		  </p>
		  <p>
		  	I would like to bring one incident happened during my student Nurse period in the year 1959 to 1961. I had come across to attend on a patient with Colostomy (Transverse) for obstructive symptoms. No appliance was available. His body was covered by news paper and placed him in the veranda on a mat very near to the Latrine. The whole area was in a bad odour. No one likes to near him. His wife and relatives used to visit him in the evening hours, by closing their Nose and stand far away from him for few minutes and go away. Flies all over him and in the surrounding places too. This incident made me to think seriously and pathetically, hence it was my long term dream to provide better Ostomy care and proper appliances to the Ostomates to lead a normal life so that they can move freely by attending all social functions. At that time the appliance supply is inadequate and people were not aware where it is available.
		  </p>
		  <p>
		  	Now two volunteers named <span class="text-danger font-weight-bold">Mr. R. Sundararajan</span> and <span class="text-danger font-weight-bold">Mr. R. Krithivasan</span> have come forward to help the needy people on a humanitarian basis. Visiting the patient at the hospital and at home, the consulting charges are based on the socio-economical status of the Ostomates.
		  </p>
		  <p>
		  	They are providing information about Ostomy care, appliances with the help of PROWESS CARE products. Its main objectives are to give counselling through arranging Ostomy visitor (Rehabilitated person leading normal life is an example) to encourage the fellow patient. They provide proper appliance at affordable cost. They attend on patients in pouching system at the patient’s doorstep. Hence patients and their family members can gain knowledge and deliver better service to the society.
		  </p>
		  <p>
		  	Today the advancement in techniques has tremendously improved and people in different countries are keen in understanding the facts through website. This website is the small beginning and definitely will expand its service in an elaborate way in the globe. This web site provides basic information on Ostomy care. It answers some of the frequently asked questions by patients (FAQ’s).
		  </p>
		  <p>
		  	Thanks to Mr. R. Sundararajan and Mr. R. Krithivasan who have taken much effort and interest on this matter. Hope this will improve still more in a better way with new knowledge and information on Ostomy care and appliances from time to time.
		  </p>
		  <p>
		  	Suggestions and feedback are always welcome for the improvement of this website.
		  </p>
		  <p>
		  	I wish their success in this field which will enable the Ostomates to utilize the services continually.
